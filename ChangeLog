V1.02 (10/18/2017)
* Changed formal name of package to SNPfoldPy and put it up on github.
  Changed all references of package in documentation to SNPfoldPy.
* Fixed memory overlap issue by removing the full 2D matrix for each
  mutant sequence by default, after folding predictions are completed.
  The summed base pair probabilities are retained. An option 
  '--keep-partit-matrices' has been added if user wishes to retain 
  these matrices in memory.

V1.01 (6/26/2013)
* In 'detect indels' function from SequenceProcessing.py, changed regular 
  expression search to search all subSNPs for a given mutant for positions 
  in center (ie. 'A44G,G50C')
* Made the same change to 'detect_strechPtMutations' function in 
  SequenceProcessing.py
* Added a 'mutantSeq' variable initialization in the 
  __init__ for class SequenceObj in SequenceProcessing.py
* In 'read_data_mutants' function, from SNPfold_commandline.py script, 
  set up a while loop to remove empty lines from mutation input files
* In 'SNPfold_commandline' function, from SNPfold_commandline.py script,
  moved correlation coefficient output header down so that it gets 
  printed at the same time as all of the results

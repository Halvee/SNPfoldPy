  * PREREQUISITES FOR RUNNING SNPfoldPy


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install SNPfoldPy, simply decompress the SNPfoldPy source directory you've
obtained (use 'tar -xvzf NAME_OF_COMPRESSED_DIR'), go into the directory, and 
then type 'python setup.py install'.   This will install SNPfoldPy as a module 
in your directory of python modules for whatever version of python you're 
using, as well as SNPfold_commandline.py as a script that can be run from 
anywhere.

PREREQUISITES FOR RUNNING SNPfoldPy

The following programs need to be installed in order for SNPfoldPy to run 
properly:
*Python (Version 2.7 is recommended to run SNPfold_commandline.py, 
 as it uses certain modules such as argparse that are included in Python 2.7.. 
 note that SNPfoldPy is NOT 
 COMPATIBILE with Python 3.0).
*Numpy
*RNAfold (preferably version 2.0)
